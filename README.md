# NumberDetection
This is a simple Project for Number Detection created with Keras.

## Install
I used [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for this project. 
If you have conda, you can install the requirements via conda
``conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt``

If you only use python, you can install the requirements via pip
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## Execution
Simply run ``python draw.py`` and you're good to go!
